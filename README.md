Gui-Pyg
Built using Python 3.8.3, not tested in other versions.
This library was built on top of PyGame version 2.0.0.dev8, you will need to install PyGame to use this library (pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev8).
You will also need SDL 2 on your machine.
NOTE: I have not been able to make this run on a Raspberry Pi yet.
